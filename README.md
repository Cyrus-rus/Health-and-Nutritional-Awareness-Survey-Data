# Health-and-Nutritional-Awareness-Survey-Data
This dataset contains comprehensive survey data from 296 individuals examining the relationship between nutritional knowledge, lifestyle habits, and health outcomes. The data reveals fascinating insights into the gap between what people know about healthy living and what they actually practice in their daily lives.

> “True health is not just about what you eat — it’s about how you sleep, move, and manage stress.”

 🎯 Objectives
- Assess general health and nutrition awareness among respondents.  
- Compare dietary habits and supplement use across gender and activity levels.  
- Analyze sleep duration, stress, and fatigue relationships.  
- Model BMI as a function of macronutrients (Protein, Carbs, Fats) using regression.  
- Draw actionable insights for public health recommendations.

Languages & Tools:
- 🐍 Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- 📊 R:ANOVA, Chi-square, Correlation, Regression  
- 🧮 Statistical Tests: Chi-Square, ANOVA, Spearman Correlation, Multiple Linear Regression  

Process Workflow:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Inferential Statistics & Hypothesis Testing  
4. Regression Modeling (Macronutrients → BMI)  
5. Sleep–Stress–Fatigue Correlation Analysis  
6. Visualization & Interpretation of Results  

### 📈 Key Findings
- Education significantly improves nutritional knowledge.  
- Sleep duration is inversely related to stress and fatigue.  
- Fat intake is a stronger predictor of BMI than protein or carbs.  
- Males report higher physical activity and protein intake.  
- Supplement use strongly correlates with higher activity levels.  

🧠 Recommendations
- Integrate sleep, stress, and nutrition in awareness programs.  
- Develop gender- and education-based health campaigns.  
- Promote nutrition label literacy to improve dietary decisions.  
- Conduct longitudinal studies to establish causal health links.  

🧩 Future Scope
- Add machine learning models for BMI and lifestyle prediction.  
- Integrate clinical biomarkers (lipid profile, glucose levels).  
- Expand sample size for broader generalization.
